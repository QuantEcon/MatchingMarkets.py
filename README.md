We simulated TTC with the help of a Matching Markets simulator that can be found hereand created an order book settlement simulation from scratch so that we can compare thetwo mechanisms.6
 Note  that  orders  are  represented  as  we  have  defined  them  mathematically  -  as  a  Python4-tuple in the same order as mentioned in this paper (c1,q1,c2,q2).  They are generated bythetypeGenfunction.While we did not write any code for visualizations, all of the code pertaining to the actualalgorithms was written by us,  and can be found insandbox.py.  In addition to writing thealgorithms that conduct the actual exchanges in TTC and the conventional workbook set-tlement mechanism, we wrote code to combine both mechanisms and run and exchange onthem.  Lastly we created methods to run each of the three mechanism separately (TTC, Or-derbook Settlement, Combo) and a method that runs all the mechanisms on the same bucketof agents and compares their performance.  Running our code will output analytics about theexchange (percent of completed orders, number of transactions...etc).You can run our code with the following line:python3   sandbox . py<mechanism> <n u m b e ro fa g e n t s>Replace<mechanism>with  one  of  the  following{ttc,settle,combo,race}and  replace<numofagents>with an integer that represents the number of agents you want to partic-ipate in the exchange.  Each agent places a single order.For example, runningpython3   sandbox . py   s e t t l e   100Will output the following in the terminal:* not specifying themechanismandnumofagentswill default to running the settlemechanism with 100 agents.  If you only specify the mechanism and not the number of agentsthe code will default to using 100 agents for the specified mechanism.
